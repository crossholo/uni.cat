Run the .py with an IDE that supports input(), or terminal.

# To-do list

* Scripts for courses questionnaires still not working
* Automate finding of already-done questionnaires (green ones)
* Compile into .exe or .app for both Mac and Windows without the need to install dependencies and use terminal
* GUI! (this will take longer)
